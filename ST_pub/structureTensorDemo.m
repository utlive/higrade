%% Background
% Gradient information serves several purposes.  It can relate
% the structure of objects in an image, identify features of interest
% for recognition/classification directly or provide the basis of further
% processing for various computer vision tasks.  For example, "edges," noted
% by regions of high gradient magnitude, are central to the task of 
% identifying defects in circuitry.  A sample "edge-detected" image using 
% the 'Image Processing Toolbox' for MATLAB is shown where 
% locations marked by white are those points that are indicative of high
% gradient magnitude, which can also be described as regions of high
% pixel contrast.

%% 
% When representing gradient information derived from an image, there are 
% several options from which to choose.  One such choice is the 
% "directional derivative" that provides a vector representation.  
% Its magnitude reflects the maximum change in pixel values while the phase 
% is directed along the orientation corresponding to the maximum change.  
% These two components are calculated as per Equations (1) and (2) respectively:
% 
% $$ \left| {\vec v} \right| = \sqrt {I_x ^2  + I_y ^2 }\qquad\qquad\qquad (1)$$       
% 
% 
% $$  \theta _v  = \tan ^{ - 1} \left( {\frac{{I_y }}{{I_x }}} \right) \qquad\qquad\qquad (2)$$   
% 
% where Ix denotes the partial derivative of image I along the x-axis.  An 
% example is shown against a horizontal step-edge image with the directional
% derivative overlaid with a red-arrow.

% The direction of the gradient in this case is based purely on the ordering
% of the pixel values.  i.e. it points from black to white.  If these colors
% were reversed, the gradient magnitude would remain the same; however, the
% direction would then be reversed such that it again pointed FROM the black
% TO the white region.
% In applications where the gradient is used to denote contours within the scene,
% such as object outlines, the polarity is of little use.  Nevertheless, this
% orientation reveals the "normal" to the contour in question.  "Orientation,"
% in this context, implies PI-periodic behavior, as in the term "horizontal
% orientation."  i.e. orientation ranges between [0,pi).  To reflect this
% periodicity, the directional derivative, when applied to the extraction
% of gradient-based structures, should also have an arrow pointed in the
% opposite direction.

% Although the directional derivative is relatively computational inexpensive, 
% it does possess a weakness.  This is best illustrated with an example.
% Given an isotropic structure, where there is no preferred direction of
% gradient, the directional derivative formula results in a zero magnitude.
% An example of such an isotropic structure is a black circle on a white
% background.  There is clearly gradient information; however, since there
% is no preferred phase, it zeros itself out.

%% Structure Tensors
% * Tensor
% * Equation
% * Example
% 
% A different method of representing gradient information is by using the 
% "structure tensor."  It also makes use of the Ix and Iy values, however,
% in a matrix form.  The term "tensor" refers to a representation of an array
% of data.  The "rank" of a tensor denotes the number of indices needed to 
% describe it. For example, a scalar value 'X' is a single value, hence 
% requires no indices.  This means that a scalar is a tensor of rank zero.  
% A vector, often represented as Vi = {V1,V2,..Vn} uses a single index = i.  
% This implies that a vector is a tensor of rank one.  A two-dimensional 
% matrix Mij is a tensor of rank two and so and so forth.  
% 
% The structure tensor matrix is formed as per the following equation:
% 
% $$ S = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {I_x^2 } & {I_x I_y }  \\  {I_x I_y } & {I_y^2 }  \\ \end{array}} \right] $$
% 
% Eigen-decomposition is then applied to the structure tensor matrix 'S' to
% form the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (L1,L2) and (e1,e2) respectively.
% These new gradient features allow a more precise description of the 
% local gradient characteristics.  For example, e1 is a unit vector
% directed normal to the gradient edge while the e2 is tangent.  The
% eigenvalues indicate the underlying certainty of the gradient structure
% along their associated eigenvector directions.  As noted by several 
% researchers, the "coherence" is obtained as a function of the eigen-
% values [Jahne 1993, Medioni et al. 2000, Tschumperle and Deriche 2002]. 
% This value is capable of distinguishing between the isotropic and uniform
% cases.  The coherence is calculated as per the following equation:
% 
% $$ c = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\left( {\frac{{\lambda _1  - \lambda _2 }}{{\lambda _1  + \lambda _2 }}} \right)^2 \qquad \mathrm{if}\left( {\lambda _1  + \lambda _2 } \right) > 0}  \\ {0\qquad\qquad\qquad \mathrm{otherwise}}  \\ \end{array}} \right. $$

    end

%%    
% It is interesting to note that if a different method is used to obtain
% the partial derivative information, for example using Horn's approach
% where the average, absolute pixel difference is used, the coherence for the
% isotropic region is one while the uniform case is zero: opposite of the 
% values obtained above.  What is key is that no matter the partial
% derivative method used, the coherence, a feature of the structure tensor,
% is able to distinguish between the two cases.  
% Many corner detection and salient point location algorithms [Forstner 1986, 
% Harris and Stevens 1988, Rohr 1997, Triggs 2004] 
% make use of the eigenvalues that are derived from the structure tensor
% to quantify the certainty in the measurements [Kenney et al. 2005].
% 
% There are other advantages to using the structure tensor representation as
% well.  For example, local shifting of edge locations in minimized when 
% applying a Gaussian smoothing operator element-by-element to the structure
% tensor [Nicolescu and Medioni, 2003].  Furthermore, the cancellations of
% opposing gradient polarity directions are prevented when structure tensors
% are summed [Brox et al. 2004].
% 
% 

%% 
% This form of gradient representation serves especially well in inferring
% structure from sparse and noisy data [Medioni et al. 2000].  The structure
% tensor is also applicable to higher dimensional data.  For example, given
% three-dimensional data, such as that from a spatio-temporal volume (x,y,time)
% or medical imaging input (x,y,z), the structure tensor is represented as
% follows:
% 
% $$ S = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {I_x^2 } \ & {I_x I_y } \ & {I_x I_z }  \\ {I_x I_y } \ & {I_y^2 } \ & {I_y I_z }  \\ {I_x I_z } \ & {I_y I_z } \ & {I_z^2 }  \\ \end{array}} \right] $$
% 
% The eigen-decomposition of the tensor of rank two results in (L1,L2,L3) and 
% (e1,e2,e3) for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively.  The 
% interpretation of these components can be visualized as 3D ellipses where
% the radii are equal to the eigenvalues in descending order and directed
% along their corresponding eigenvectors.
